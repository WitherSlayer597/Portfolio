- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm @WitherSlayer597

I am answering some questions for the course CS250 in my README section of my github profile.
**********************************************************************************************
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating ‚Äúuser stories‚Äù help with this?
  Interpreting user needs means breaking down requirements into specific, actionable goals. User stories are helpful because they capture needs from the end-user‚Äôs perspective, making it clearer why each feature matters. This approach also helps build empathy, which naturally leads to more intuitive design. Each user story lays out the "who," "what," and "why," guiding development with a strong focus on creating a positive user experience.
**********************************************************************************************
How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  I prefer developing programs by building up from the basics, starting with core functionality and refining as I go, usually looking out for areas that can be optimized and using resources that are available to me at the moment. Agile practices like sprint planning, daily check-ins, and regular reviews help keep the team and project on the same page. Looking ahead, I want to use Agile methods to stay adaptable, transparent, and focused on creating features that genuinely improve the user experience.
**********************************************************************************************
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  Being a good team member means actively contributing to shared goals, communicating effectively, and being supportive of others‚Äô work. It involves accountability, respect for others‚Äô time and skills, and a collaborative mindset. Good team members embrace feedback, contribute their expertise, and help create a positive environment for the team to succeed together.
