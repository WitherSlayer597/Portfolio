Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The problem that was being solved here was to build an item-tracking system for a made up company named corner grocer. A project like this when scaled large enough and future proof could become an inventory management system. Some time ago I worked for Lowes Home Improvement, as a retail emvironment the store used a GUI inventory and checkout system, however when the system had bugs or issues or lag etc, we relied on the internal inventory management system that looks very much like this product only with a few more features. 
  
Wh0at did you do particularly well? Utilization of classes, noth pubblic and private, utilization and initialization of vectors, being able to read files and output files from visual studio by addint the list txt file and outputting the frequesncy file.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on? I think there can always be room for improvement when creating a project. I think that with more added features, potentially some kind of login to authorize that a user is actually supposed to be using the code would add to security. From my experience at lowes with their systems, they always had us enter some kind of Employee number or ID. With my experience in IT there are jobs that require you to have some kind of badge or card that authenticates you when logging into a system or computer. I am sure that adding some sort of barcode scanner or item SKUing system would allow for more optimization for a real life grocery example but in this case we are limited to only selling fruit and veggies. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network? I have always struggle in C++ to open, read, and output files. Geeks for Geeks and stackoverflow usually help with problems like this, quite a few times I have gone to github and have seen peoples existing projects that do similar things to this and it is pretty simple to understand their process of thinking and file manpiulation. Here are some sources that I have used in the past and still refer to.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work? I keep pretty good track of the groceries and products that I buy on a weekly basis, this is setup through in a excel file that is store on a NAS and the people that I live with all can add and remove things to this file as they choose. I think that being able to more thoroughly track this can aid in our monthly budget and can later create a graph to understand our usage and spending habbits with said weekly groceries and products. 

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable? I think that this project can be maintained and expanded, I made the project readable by using fstream a function of C++ that is used still in 2024. AS I usually always do and I think is standardized in most programs I serpated my functions and my main functions but I think that making each function in its own file and calling it using #include <function> can also be used to expand each characteristic and feature of the program.
